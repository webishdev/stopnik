# STOPnik

The simple and small `OAuth2 | OpenId Connect` server that secures applications without hassle.

**STOPnik** does not have any persistence layer and will only work in-memory with the clients and users defined in the configuration file (`YAML`).
When restarted, all issued tokens will become invalid/forgotten by **STOPnik**.

This project was used to learn [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749), [OpenId Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0-final.html) and [Go](https://go.dev/).

The logo mascot was mostly inspired by the nice work of [gopherize.me](https://github.com/matryer/gopherize.me) and redrawn by hand as a vector graphic with additional body and a cool hat.
